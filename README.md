  ## Description
  #JavaScript30 - Project #8 - Fun with HTML5 Canvas
  <br><br>

  These code exercises use the following technologies: JavaScript and HTML. 
  <br><br>
  Created a page to draw using your mouse. The color advances through the rainbow, and your line width grows or shrinks, as you move forward.
  <br><br>
  Low key obsessed with this one. We didn't learn anything about Canvas in Bootcamp, so this is new info. 
  Made a lot of notes but here are some key takeaways:<br> <br>
    - Learned about the HTML Canvas element/tag. It creates a canvas you can draw on using JS.<br>
    - Learned more about mouse up and down events, etc.<br>
    - HSL: H is for hue. S is for saturation. L is for lightness.<br>
    - Global Composite Operator - use this to blend, etc.<br>
